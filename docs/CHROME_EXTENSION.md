Hello everyone, this is Tab Master an easy-to-use chrome extension for increasing your productivity by providing an easy and intuitive way to navigate trough tabs and history

By easy way, this is what I mean. Have you ever used discord search functionality (show pic, like a slide) or mac spotlight feature or Visual Studio Code File Search Feature or any other searching feature before to navigate trough the wanted environment and every time you switched back to chrome felt like something is missing? Well, with our extension we fill out this hole by giving you:

- User friendly modal which can be opened with `CMD`|`CTRL` + K (depending on what OS you are using) and close by pressing escape
- (FOLLOWED BY) Fuzzy search for filtering your opened tabs and history, finding the best result
- Fully Customizable features (by using the popup or configuration page), where you can turn off the extension itself or ...explainOtherSettings
- Expanding/Collapsing tabs so you can see the full info (I don't know about this one)

Give it a try! We would highly appreciate your feedback on this link: >>LINK>>

Also one more thing to mention. This project is not sponsored by anyone so we would gladly appreciate if you help us develop this extension even further by clicking on this [link](google.com)
