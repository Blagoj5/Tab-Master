Thanks for showing interest to contribute to Tab Master ðŸ’—, you're awesome!

When it comes to open source, there are different ways you can contribute, all
of which are valuable. Here's a few guidelines that should help you as you
prepare your contribution.

## Setup the Project

The following steps will get you up and running to contribute to Tab Master:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of
   [this page](https://github.com/Blagoj5/Tab-Master))

2. Clone your fork locally

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<your_github_username>/Tab-Master.git
cd Tab-Master
```

3. Setup all the dependencies and packages by running `yarn`. This command will
   install dependencies and bootstrap the repo using `preconstruct`

<!-- > If you run into any issues during this step, kindly reach out to the Chakra UI
> React team here: https://discord.gg/chakra-ui -->

## Development

To improve our development process, we've set up tooling and systems. Tab Master
uses a monorepo structure and we each package is different part of the extension (modal, config page).

### Tooling

- [Testing Library](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) jest together with puppeteer for End-to-End (E2E) tests
- [Changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) for changes
  documentation, changelog generation, and release management.

### Commands

**`yarn`**: bootstraps the entire project, symlinks all dependencies for
cross-component development and builds all components.

**`yarn build`**: run build for all packages.

**`yarn build:watch`**: uses nodemon to watch any changes made in the packages and rebuild when change happened

**`yarn zip`**: zips the built directory and it's ready to be published

**`yarn test`**: runs jest + puppeteer to test the extension

## Think you found a bug?

Please conform to the issue template and provide a clear path to reproduction
with a code example.

## Proposing new or changed API?

Please provide thoughtful comments and some sample API code. Proposals that
don't line up with our roadmap or don't have a thoughtful explanation will be
closed.

## Making a Pull Request?

Pull requests need only approval âœ… of atleast one or more collaborators to be merged; when
the PR author is a collaborator, that counts as one.

### Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with
the commit conventions used in this repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention
`category(scope or module): message` in your commit message while using one of
the following categories:

- `feat / feature`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new
  features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an
  issue if present)
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for
  usage of a lib or cli usage)
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to
  dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing
  ones)
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e.
  github actions, ci system)
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above
  categories

If you are interested in the detailed specification you can visit
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ or check out the
[Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

### Steps to PR

1. Fork of the tab-master repository and clone your fork

2. Create a new branch out of the `main` branch. We follow the convention
   `[type/scope]`. For example `fix/accordion-hook` or `docs/menu-typo`. `type`
   can be either `docs`, `fix`, `feat`, `build`, or any other conventional
   commit type. `scope` is just a short id that describes the scope of work.

3. Make and commit your changes following the
   commit convention. As you develop, you can run `yarn pkg <module> test` to make sure everything works as expected.

4. Run `yarn changeset` to create a detailed description of your changes. This
   will be used to generate a changelog when we publish an update.
   [Learn more about Changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/tree/master/packages/cli).
   Please note that you might have to run `git fetch origin main:master` (where
   origin will be your fork on GitHub) before `yarn changeset` works.

<!-- > If you made minor changes like CI config, prettier, etc, you can run
> `yarn changeset add --empty` to generate an empty changeset file to document
> your changes. -->

### Tests

All commits that fix bugs or add features need a test.

> **Dear team:** Please do not merge code without tests

## Want to write a blog post or tutorial
